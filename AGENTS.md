# Study Lamp

A learning-companion webapp: name a topic → get a brief, roadmap, and resources — then a journal and Q&A where the companion learns *alongside* you, maintaining a shared memory that shapes every future response. Next.js (App Router) + TypeScript. Installable PWA; runs in **local mode** (no auth, JSON file) when Supabase env vars are absent, **cloud mode** (Supabase auth + Postgres, invite-only) when present.

## Status
<!-- STATUS:START -->
- **Updated:** 2026-07-17
- **Phase:** v3.0 "Study Room" built — Library tab per topic (paste article/YouTube links), in-app article reader + YouTube embed, Discuss panel grounded in extracted text/transcripts (feeds shared memory), session greeting strip; v2 deployed and live
- **Architecture:** Next.js App Router; 5 LLM routes (topic/journal/ask/discuss/greeting) + library ingestion + on-demand content route + op-based storage route + keepalive cron; StorageAdapter with JsonFileStorage (local) / SupabaseStorage (cloud, RLS); middleware auth gate; service worker + manifest; shared UI atoms in components/lamp-ui.tsx
- **Next:** 📋 Naseer re-runs supabase/schema.sql (new library_items + discussion_messages tables), redeploys, verifies the Study Room in cloud mode (see docs/next-steps.md)
- **Blocked on:** the human-only steps in docs/next-steps.md (schema re-run, redeploy)

## Commands

- `npm run dev` — dev server (uses port 3001 if 3000 is busy on this machine)
- `npm run build` — production build + typecheck

## Golden rules

- **Never call the model from the browser.** All LLM calls go through `app/api/{topic,journal,ask}/route.ts` → `lib/llm.ts`; keys live only in `.env.local` / Vercel env.
- **Prompts in `lib/prompts.ts` are frozen contracts** (proven in the prototype) — refine only with evaluation, per the handoff doc.
- **Memory is always fully rewritten by the model, never appended by the app** — this keeps it compact and coherent.
- **Data access in cloud mode always goes through the request-scoped Supabase client** (RLS enforces per-user isolation); the secret key is used only by `/api/keepalive`, never for user data.
- `data/` and `.env.local` are gitignored; never commit either.
- Bump `VERSION` in `public/sw.js` whenever the service worker changes, or clients keep the old one.

## Docs index

- Product spec, prompt contracts, design tokens, v1 scope → `reference/study-lamp-handoff.md`
- Original Claude.ai artifact the UI was ported from → `reference/learning-companion.jsx`
- Why v2 is shaped this way (hosting choice, auth, schema, market research, roadmap) → `docs/v2-design-and-research.md`
- Naseer needs the human-only to-do list (Supabase setup, email templates, deploy, data import) → `docs/next-steps.md`
- Touching Supabase schema/auth/RLS → `supabase/schema.sql` is the single source of truth; re-run it in the SQL editor after edits (it's idempotent)
